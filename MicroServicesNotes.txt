Circuit Breaker pattern :

The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern used in modern software development to detect the failure of an operation and prevent 
the application from continuously trying to perform the failed operation. This pattern is particularly useful for distributed systems 
where a service might become temporarily unavailable or response time might be higher due to network issues or high load.

Realtime Example : Saving data to blob storage

Polly :

Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner.
