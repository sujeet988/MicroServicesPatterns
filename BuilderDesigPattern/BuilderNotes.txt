Builder Design Pattern Notes :
--it is used when we need to create object step by step
-> Stringbuilder based on builder Design Patterns
-> at every step it return mediator object or builder obejct not 
complete  objects. means home/prodcut is still not ready
-> like for string builder we have ToString() that returns final object or value.
-> its reduces complexity of lots of optional paramters.
->mandatory/optional
--in build design pattern not support dynamic nature of objetc but in decorator
  design pattern support.
