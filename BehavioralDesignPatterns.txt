Behavioral Design Patterns :
-> Guides how different objects communciate with each other 
effectively  and distribute task efficiently , making software
system flexible  and easy to maintain

->Behavioral Patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of 
responsibilities between objects.
Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but 
also the patterns of communication between them. 
These patterns characterize complex control flow that’s difficult 
to follow at run-time.

There are three recurring themes in these patterns:

Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes.
Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance.
Behavioral object patterns are concerned with encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it.
