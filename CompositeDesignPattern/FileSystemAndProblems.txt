File Systems:

File and Directory(files or directory)

Notes : 
  public void ls()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Directory Name: " + directoryName);
            foreach (Object obj in objectList)
            {

                if (obj is File)
                {
                    ((File)obj).ls();
                }
                else if (obj is Directory)
                {
                    ((Directory)obj).ls();
                }
            }
* problem : in this approach problem is that we have use to mutiple if else
  for validate type of  file and cast the object.
  using composite design pattern  we can solve this problem
