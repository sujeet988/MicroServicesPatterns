Cqrs(Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
-> CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern 
that separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing 
CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, 
and security. The flexibility created by migrating to CQRS allows a 
system to better evolve over time and prevents update commands 
from causing merge conflicts at the domain level.
