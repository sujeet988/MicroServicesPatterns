*Rate limiter
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rate-limiting-in-system-design/
Rate limiting is a technique for limiting network traffic. 
It sets a limit on how many requests a client can make to an API within a certain time period. 

*Why is rate limiting used?
Avoid resource starvation due to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Ensure that servers are not overburdened. Using rate restriction per user
ensures fair and reasonable use without harming other users.
Control the flow of information, for example, prevent a single worker from
accumulating a backlog of unprocessed items while other workers are idle.

*Algorithms to Design a Rate Limiter API

The Token bucket
Leaky bucket
Fixed window Counter
Sliding window logs 
Sliding window counters. 


Fixed Window Counter :
A Fixed Window Counter is a simple rate limiting algorithm where you count the number of requests 
made in a fixed time window. 
If the count exceeds the limit, further requests are blocked until the window resets.
Example : in asp.net we can implements this using custom middleware
