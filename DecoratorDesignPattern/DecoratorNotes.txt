**The Decorator Design Pattern 
-> allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. 
   This is done by creating a decorator class that wraps the original class.
-> Real time use case :
 1.pizza shop-> like base pizza and after this mutiple top like, veggie extra, extra chigg(decorate)
  base pizaa+extra cheese+mushroom
 2. cofee
 --base coffe(expressoo) + (cream-Decorator)
 3.car -> base car + extra feature(seat cover  + ac)\

  why we need decorator pattern:
 -- class explosion -> this reduce class explosion
 -- reduce multiple class  to less class
 -- it is has-A and ISA-A Relation ship-both
